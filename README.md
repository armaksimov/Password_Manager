This repository is used for the Password Manager project, written in C.

Expected minimum functionality:
  1. Create/generate/change/delete password struct.
  2. Create/change/delete application struct (consists of the app name, username, password structure).
  3. Have a Linked List of passwords (requires implementation of the linked list based on password nodes).
  4. Save the list of passwords as compilation ends.
  5. Extract list of passwords as the program starts.
  6. Encrypt (in some way) every password before writing it to the file.
  7. Decrypt every password when the list is extracted from the text file.
  8. Create a console menu allowing to add a password to the list, remove a password from the list, change the existing password.

Optional things to do:
  1. Create a UI using GTK library or any other tool.
  2. Create a login/create account functionality.
